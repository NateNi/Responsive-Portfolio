            <p>I am a student in the University of Texas Coding Bootcamp and plan to find a job as a Full Stack Developer in the near future.  I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from Texas A&amp;M University and graduate course experience at the University of Washington.  Additionally, I studied Computer Science at the University of Texas at the Bachelors level.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, thrifting, exploring the Austin area, and cooking.  One of my major plans is to travel and see the world.  I studied Japanese for several semesters in college and plan to continue learning on my own.</p>
            <p>One of my personal goals is to read all of the books on NPR's list of the top 100 scifi and fantasy books.  I have a cat named Tetra and might to look to adopt a dog in the future.  I briefly lived in Seattle and might look to eventually move back to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
